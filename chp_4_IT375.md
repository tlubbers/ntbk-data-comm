# Chapter 4 - Converting to Digital Signals

## Data Rate Versus Signal Rate

S = N*1/R, where N=data rate in bps and R = number of data elements carried in one signal element

Bit rate is the number of bits per second. Baud rate is the number of signal elements per second. In the analog transmission of digital data, the baud rate is less than or equal to the bit rate.
